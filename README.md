Conclusion
1. Data Collection
Source: Collect text data containing URLs from publicly available datasets or web scraping.
Format: The data is organized in a format where each entry contains a text field with URLs and a label indicating whether the URL is malicious.
2. Feature Extraction
Text Preprocessing: Clean the text data by removing unnecessary characters, normalizing text, and tokenizing.
URL Extraction: Extract URLs from the text using regular expressions.
Feature Engineering: Convert text into numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.
3. Creation of Feature and Target Variables
Features: Include text-based features extracted from the data.
Target: A binary label indicating whether the URL is malicious (1) or benign (0).
4. Train-Test Split
Splitting Strategy: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models. Typically, an 80-20 or 70-30 split is used.
5. Model Training
Algorithms Used:

Logistic Regression
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Gaussian Naive Bayes
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
Training Process: Train each model on the training dataset using appropriate hyperparameters.

6. Model Accuracy Analysis
Evaluation Metrics: Assess the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Comparison: Compare the performance of different models to determine which one provides the highest accuracy.
7. Prediction and URL Extraction
Prediction: Use the trained models to make predictions on new text data.
URL Extraction: Apply NLP techniques to extract URLs from the text and classify them based on the modelâ€™s predictions.
8. Conclusion
Best Model: The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy among the tested models.
Insights: Discuss why the Random Forest Classifier outperformed other models and the implications of the results.
